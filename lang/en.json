    "seoP1": "<strong>AI YouTube Channel Recommender</strong> is a free web service that uses the world's leading AI technologies - <strong>Google Gemini</strong>, <strong>OpenAI ChatGPT</strong>, and <strong>Anthropic Claude</strong> - to recommend the perfect YouTube channels for you.",
    "seoP2": "Unlike YouTube's algorithm which relies solely on viewing history, our service analyzes various factors including <strong>age, gender, region, content category, style, and video length</strong> to find channels that truly match your preferences.",
    "seoP3": "With three different AI engines analyzing simultaneously, you get <strong>diverse perspectives</strong> rather than just one viewpoint. We support over 14 categories including gaming, music, education, cooking, travel, tech, and finance, plus 7 content styles, from Shorts to long-form videos.",
    "seoP4": "We prioritize <strong>privacy protection</strong> - your input is never stored on our servers and is deleted immediately after generating recommendations. Discover new YouTube channels and enrich your content life with this free service!",
    "faqTitle": "❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)",
    "faq1Q": "Is this service free?",
    "faq1A": "Yes, it's completely free. With the free tier, you can get up to 3 recommendations per day using Gemini AI. To use ChatGPT or Claude, enter your own API keys for unlimited access.",
    "faq2Q": "What's the difference between Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude?",
    "faq2A": "These three AIs are large language models developed by different companies (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic). Each AI has different training data and algorithms, so they provide different perspectives on the same query. Comparing recommendations from multiple AIs helps you discover more diverse channels.",
    "faq3Q": "Is my personal information safe?",
    "faq3A": "Your age, gender, interests, and other inputs are only used to generate AI recommendations and are not stored on servers. All data is deleted immediately after recommendations are complete. If you enter API keys, they are stored only in your browser's local storage and are never sent to our servers.",
    "faq4Q": "How is this different from YouTube's algorithm?",
    "faq4A": "YouTube's algorithm recommends based on viewing history, while our service recommends based on your directly inputted preferences. It's useful when you want to find channels in new areas or escape the filter bubble of existing algorithms.",
    "faq5Q": "What if I don't like the recommendations?",
    "faq5A": "Try being more specific with your inputs, or add more detailed keywords in the 'Additional Interests' field. You can also try getting recommendations from a different AI engine for different perspectives.",
    "faq6Q": "Can I use this on mobile?",
    "faq6A": "Yes, it's built as a responsive website and works on all devices including smartphones, tablets, and PCs. Just access it through your web browser - no app installation needed.",
    "faq7Q": "Where can I get API keys?",
    "faq7A": "Gemini API keys can be obtained from Google AI Studio (aistudio.google.com), ChatGPT API keys from OpenAI Platform (platform.openai.com), and Claude API keys from Anthropic Console (console.anthropic.com). Links are provided when you click the API Key Settings button.",
    "faq8Q": "What languages are supported?",
    "faq8A": "We currently support 4 languages: Korean, English, Japanese, and Chinese. You can change the language using the selector in the top right corner. Recommendations are also provided in your selected language.",
